## Open Overlay

In Figma, when you create a prototype with the "Open overlay" interaction, you need to pay attention to the position of the overlay object.

If the overlay object is inside the same frame as the trigger element, Figma may treat it as part of the normal layout and it wonâ€™t appear properly as an overlay.

To make the overlay work as expected, the overlay object should be either:

- outside of the frame that contains the trigger element, or  
- not inside any frame (placed directly on the page).

In short: Do not put the overlay inside the same frame as the trigger element.
