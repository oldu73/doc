## Line chart

Line chart with time series, e.g.:

```txt
2024-12-09 14:35:16.000, 81
2024-12-09 14:37:16.000, 78
2024-12-09 14:39:16.000, 479
2024-12-09 14:41:16.000, 480
```

Problem of copying/pasting this directly in excel will lead with first column as 'General' format and you should select it (column) and convert it to date format before trying to insert a line chart.

As a quick win, use 'Scatter' chart instead.
