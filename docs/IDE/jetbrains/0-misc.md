## Diff display mode

new tab VS new window

JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, PyCharm, etc.) allow you to choose how file diffs are displayed—either inside the main editor as a tab or in a separate window.
You can easily switch between these two modes using the following steps:

### Show Diff in a Separate Window

Open any file diff.

Right-click the “Diff for File:” tab at the top of the editor.

Select “Show Diff in Separate Window”.

The diff will now open in an external window instead of an editor tab.

### Show Diff Back in the Editor Tab

In the external diff window, click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner.

Select “Show Diff in Editor Tab”.

The diff will return to the standard editor tab display mode.
