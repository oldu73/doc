### One shot

Command line, manual sending, one raw data frame (Like Network Stuff):

```console
echo -n "830f9d10362f4bc8a1c.." | perl -e 'print pack "H*", <STDIN>' | timeout 0.2 nc -w 1 -u <ip> <port> | xxd -p
```

### Script straight or line by line

Read file straight forward or line by line.

sample (file):

```txt
8308352739096415820f01020102128362d80bb162d80bb11c1e6..
8308359739077103745f01020102b2df62d80bb262d80bb11bd9d..
..
```

readsample script, chmod +x then ./readsample to execute:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

trap 'exit 130' INT

modearg="mode arg = -s for straight or -l for line by line"
filearg="file arg = input file name"
iparg="ip arg = server IP address"
portarg="port arg = server port number"

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  printf '\n'
  echo "usage: "$modearg", "$filearg", "$iparg", "$portarg
  printf '\n'
  echo "e.g.: $ ./readsample -s|-l sample 192.168.1.141 50300"
  printf '\n'
  exit 1
fi

input=$2
ip=$3
port=$4

printf '\n'

while getopts "h?s?l" opt; do
  case "$opt" in
    h|\?)
      echo "help!.. not implemented yet, sorry :("
      printf '\n'
      exit 0
      ;;
    s)
      echo "straight mode.."
      printf '\n'

      printf '\n'

      while IFS= read -r line
      do
        echo "$line"
        printf '\n'
        echo -n "$line" | perl -e 'print pack "H*", <STDIN>' | timeout 0.2 nc -w 1 -u "$ip" "$port" | xxd -p
        printf '\n'
      done < "$input"

      printf '\n'
      echo 'Done.'
      printf '\n'

      exit 0
      ;;
    l)
      echo "line by line mode.."
      printf '\n'

      printf '\n'

      exec 3<&0

      printf '\n'

      while IFS= read -r line
      do
        echo "$line"
        printf '\n'
        echo -n "$line" | perl -e 'print pack "H*", <STDIN>' | timeout 0.2 nc -w 1 -u "$ip" "$port" | xxd -p
        printf '\n\nPress <enter> to continue: ' >&2
        read keypress <&3
        printf '\n'
      done < "$input"
      exec 3<&-

      printf '\n'
      echo 'Done.'
      printf '\n'

      exit 0
      ;;
  esac
done
```

## Forward traffic

Forward network communications when you are forced to keep the IP address of a server because of devices deployed in the field that are no longer maintainable to change the IP address of the server with which they communicate.

Solutions:

- [socat](#socat), communication relay  
- [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) open-source Edge Router

## telnet

Open connection:

```console
telnet localhost <tcp port number>
```

Close connection:

```console
type Ctrl + ] on your keyboard

telnet>

type in the word 'close' to close the session
```

---

## netcat

Netcat (nc) operates by initiating a TCP connection to a remote host.

The most basic syntax is:

```console
netcat [options] <host> <port>
```

---

## socat

The [`socat`](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/getting-started-socat) utility is a relay for bidirectional data transfers between two independent data channels.

For multiple connections, use the `fork` option as used in the examples below:

```console
socat TCP4-LISTEN:81,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:TCP4:192.168.1.10:80
```

This example listens on port 81, accepts connections, and forwards the connections to port 80 on the remote host.

## check open port

### TCP

```console
telnet <ip address or alias> <port #>
```

to quit:

```console
ctrl+]
quit
```

### UDP

```console
nmap -sU -p <port #> <ip address or alias>
```
