## Spread Vs Rest

Same synthax 'â€¦' for the Spread operator and the Rest operator.

The difference between the two is the context of use, they do not have the same effect.

### Spread

The spread syntax expands iterables into individual elements.

In other words, the spread operator unpacks the elements of an iterable object.

[Spread demo](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax):

```js
function sum(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(sum(...numbers)); // expected output: 6

console.log(sum.apply(null, numbers)); // expected output: 6
```

### Rest

The rest operator puts the rest of some specific user-supplied values into a JavaScript array.

In other words, the rest parameter packs the elements into an array.

[Rest demo](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters):

```js
function sum(...theArgs) {
  let total = 0;
  for (const arg of theArgs) {
    total += arg;
  }
  return total;
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // expected output: 6

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // expected output: 10
```
