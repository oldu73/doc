# Compose - 9 - Dockerfile

Docker Compose - Dockerfile

!WSL2, advised to not use a mounted volume like '/mnt/c/' for handling a project to avoid slowness and live reload issues.
Instead, prefer usage of a "native" WSL2 folder like for e.g. '/home/user/react-nginx'

Dockerfile and Docker Compose to set up a client application composed of:  

- React  
- NGINX  

***

## Setup of client application project

### Node

'create-React-app' is a script to install with 'npm' will pre-configure a 'webpack' environnement and give use access to a development server and a test server and a build command for production.

Role of 'NGINX' (http server) is to treat all http(s) request and return response from 'React' application to requester.

In this chapter we will see two new features:  

- Dockerfile multi staging, defined with many 'from'.  
- Stdin_open and TTY, two new options of Docker Compose.  

Prerequisite, install on host machine:  

- 'nvm' - [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)  
- 'Node.js'

Set/check installation with:

```console
// Setup project root folder
mkdir react-nginx
cd react-nginx

// To install 'nvm'
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

// Check
nvm

// Get last version
nvm ls-remote | tail
.
.
v17.0.1
        v17.1.0
        v17.2.0
        v17.3.0

// Install last version
nvm install 17.3.0

node -v
v17.3.0

node
Welcome to Node.js v17.3.0.       
Type ".help" for more information.
>
(To exit, press Ctrl+C again or Ctrl+D or type .exit)
>
```

### React

Instal 'React' with 'npx' (like npm but executed once with last script release):

```console
npx create-react-app client
cd client
ls
README.md  node_modules  package-lock.json  package.json  public  src
npm start
.
.
Compiled successfully!

You can now view client in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
```

Browse to: - [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Test (launch tests contained in react-nginx/client/src/App.test.js):

```console
npm run test
```

!! Fail on WSL2 :(

Build for production (add a build folder to the project, this is the folder to return via NGINX for client):

```console
npm run build
```

All of this just to initialize the project locally on host machine.

### Dockerized

We may now **delete the 'node_modules' folder** ('node_modules' folder will then be only in container initialized with dependencies through 'npm install' command in 'Dockerfile'):

```console
rm -rf node_modules/
```

Add a 'Dockerfile' in client project folder '/home/user/react-nginx/client':

```console
touch Dockerfile
```

Dockerfile:

```text
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Build docker image:

```console
docker build -t myreact .

docker image ls
REPOSITORY                        TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE  
myreact                           latest    c4c1b5bb9d21   45 seconds ago   483MB

docker run --rm --name react -p 3000:3000 myreact
```

Browse to: - [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

***

## Live reload

It's important to launch **from a terminal** a based VS Code instance from root client application folder to get live reload effect that works:

```console
cd .../react-nginx/client
code .
```

For development purpose, to automatically propagate local changes to container.

Bind mount project folder:

```console
docker run --rm --name react -p 3000:3000 --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)",target=/app myreact
```

!! => FAIL!! Why? Because when bind mount it crush all what was contained in container '/app' folder with local content and in local there isn't anymore 'node_modules' folder.

To avoid this unwanted behavior and keep 'node_modules' in container folder not erased by bind mount (also needed for live reload feature), we bind an anonymous volume targeted on remote container '/app/node_modules' folder.

Also, to avoid 'EACCES: permission denied' issue on '/app/node_modules/.cache' folder we modify 'Dockerfile' as follow:

```text
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
# To avoid 'EACCES: permission denied' issue on '/app/node_modules/.cache' folder
RUN mkdir -p node_modules/.cache && chmod -R 777 node_modules/.cache
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Bind mount project folder + anonymous volume with '/app/node_modules' as target:

```console
docker run --rm --name react -p 3000:3000 --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)",target=/app --mount type=volume,target=/app/node_modules myreact
```

It's advised to run with '--rm' option when using anonymous volume to suppress it automatically on stop in addition to container suppression.

Test live reload by changing text '.. save to reload.' with e.g. 'Hello, world!" in 'src/App.js' and then observe live effect at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in an Internet browser.

***

## Set up Docker Compose

docker-compose.yml

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  client:
    build: .
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: .
        target: /app
      - type: volume
        target: /app/node_modules
```

Reset Docker:

```console
docker system prune -a
docker volume prune
```

Start service:

```console
docker-compose up
```

You may observe live reload working by changing 'App.js' content and 'localhost:3000' changing accordingly.
