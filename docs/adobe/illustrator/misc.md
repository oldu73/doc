## Align on key object

If you want to align two objects in Adobe Illustrator, but keep one of those objects in place, then you need a KEY OBJECT. Select both objects, and then simply single click the object you want to stay put. This'll add a thicker selection to that object and when you align, your original object will stay in place!
